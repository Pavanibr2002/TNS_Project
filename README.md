In modern web application development, Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations are fundamental functionalities that enable efficient management of data. This project aims to implement a robust CRUD operations system using the Spring Boot framework in Java. Spring Boot provides a streamlined and convention-over-configuration approach to building Java-based enterprise applications, making it an excellent choice for developing scalable and maintainable CRUD applications.
